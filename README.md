# 💫 About Me:
I’m currently working on building and improving software-focused projects with a strong interest in full-stack web development, automation, and problem-solving using Java and Python, while also maintaining hands-on experience with IoT and Raspberry Pi projects from my academic background. I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful open-source projects, student-led tech initiatives, and real-world problem-solving applications where I can both contribute and learn from others. I’m looking for help with sharpening my software architecture skills, writing cleaner and more scalable code, and gaining deeper exposure to industry-level development practices. I’m currently learning advanced data structures and algorithms in Java, modern web technologies, cloud fundamentals, and automation tools like UiPath as part of my Information Science and Engineering journey. Ask me about Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects, IoT system design, basic cloud concepts, Java programming, or getting started with student tech projects. Fun fact: I started with hardware and IoT projects, but that journey sparked my interest in software, and now I’m actively transitioning toward building impactful software-centric solutions.<br>
